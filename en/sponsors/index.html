<p>在收費方面，我們提供客戶「用多少才付多少」的租賃概念，不需花費數百萬來建立資訊系統，只需每月或每年給付固定且合理的金額，就能擁有與國際企業一樣的服務。在捕夢網的規劃中，我們擁有高度的「擴充性」，即使客戶在短期內需要在硬體或線路上做調整，我們也能完全配合，只要一通電話，客戶的所承租捕夢網的一切服務都能立即調整，完全符合客戶需求。</p>

<p>由於捕夢網多年來對於服務的堅持，客戶數已經突破一萬人。近年來各種獎項的肯定，包括連續三年(2010~2012)獲得科技今獎與網路人企獎、國家品質玉山獎(最家企業獎與最佳產品獎)、ISO 27001國際資訊安全認證、經濟部透明化信賴電子商店認證。但捕夢網不會以此滿足，因為，唯有客戶滿意，才是我們的目標。</p>
